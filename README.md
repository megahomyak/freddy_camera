# Freddy Camera

**Disclaimer**: I do not own Five Nights At Freddy's (the game from which the character and the jumpscare were taken from). This program is just a little silly joke.

**Advice**: if you had any issues during the installation, usage, or configuration of the program, please, contact the developer at https://t.me/megahomyak

This program will allow you to create a fake webcam and put the magnificient FREDDY FAZBEAR as its output. You will be able to use the added camera in Discord, Skype and other applications that accept camera output and allow you to choose the camera. Freddy's jaw will move with you speaking! All of the Freddy frames are taken from his jumpscare.
